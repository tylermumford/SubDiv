SubDiv is an old program of mine â€” the very first, I believe. Unfortunately, I haven't taken good care of it, and all of my copies of it have been lost.

Thankfully, a kindhearted soul heard my request for help, and now version 1.0.48 (I think; not yet verified) is available for download.

Perhaps I'll resurrect SubDiv someday, but probably not. In any case, I'll make sure to preserve what I can here on GitHub.
